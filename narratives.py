        "The year is 3047. Music is alive... but it is not well. Music is no longer created by human beings, but by machines from Algorythm Corporation. Algorythm centrally controls all music production in the Universe and all music sounds exactly the same.",
        "On a school trip, you visit the ancient ruins of the Berklee College of Music, where your teacher tells you that the Algorhythm Corporation started. During the boring field trip, you and your friends decide to take a “detour” and explore the forbidden area of Berklee.",
        "You find a mysterious object. It is made out of wood and has strings on it. Your friends tell you that it is a piece of junk, but for some reason, you feel the urge to brush your hands over the object. As your fingers touch the strings, you hear the most beautiful and alien sound you have ever heard in your life.",
        "As soon as the object makes the sound, Algorythym’s minions, the Deaftones, suddenly appear and take the mysterious object away from you. They return you to the field trip and eventually you go home. But you can’t stop thinking about the sound. As you try to fall asleep, the sound continues to ring in your head. Then you drift off to sleep...",
        "A being named Doremi Fasolati appears and tells you that it heard your call. You are confused and don’t understand. Doremi explains that the object you found is an ancient instrument called a “guitar” and that strumming it has awakened Doremi from his slumber.",
        "You don’t understand that a guitar is a musical instrument. You thought all music has always been made by the Algorhythm Corporation on machines. Doremi tells you that there is much more to music than what Algorhythm has made.",
        "Doremi tells you music used to be made with many mysterious objects called “instruments” by ordinary people, not machines. And the sound was so beautiful and diverse that it made people move their bodies in all kinds of ways.  But you wonder how people actually made music. How did they know what to do?",
        "Doremi tells you that to understand how to make music, you must first find the 7 Gems of Ionia. Once you have found and mastered all 7 Gems, Doremi will teach you how to harness their power to make music…"

            "Doremi has sent you the locations of the 7 Gems of Ionia and a sample of the special sound that each gem emits. The only way to find a gem is to get close enough to hear its sound.  But beware!  Many have tried to find the gems over thousands of years and treasure hunters have left many traps. If the sound does not match the sample that Doremi gave you, it’s a trap!"

            "After successfully finding and mastering the 7 Gems of Ionia, Doremi appears once again. You must take the 7 Gems of Ionia to Doremi’s planet, Concordia, and place them on the Altar of Sonus Bonum. Only then can you learn the secret to making music to defeat Algorhythm once and for all.",
            "But Doremi tells you that Algorythm has discovered that you are collecting the gems and has sent the DeafTones to capture you and destroy the gems before you get to Concordia! He adds that you now have a weapon, the gems themselves…"

                "On the way to Concordia, you meet the DeafTones Fleet. Each ship has a unique transmission code that it uses to communicate with other ships and verify its identity. If you can imitate the transmission code, the you can pass by the DeafTones without being noticed.",
                "To imitate the transmission, first click on an approaching ship, then select two gems which are musically the same distance apart as the two tones represented in the transmission. Make sure you succeed before any of the ships get too close, or you'll be discovered!"

                "Algorhthm has noticed something seems off with his DeafTones fleet routes, so he's created another new type of ship with a powerful gem suppressing transmitter. Spot these ships by the red suppression signals coming from the ship.",
                "When facing these ships, you may not be able to use gems which sound exactly like the transmission, but remember, all that matters is that the gems are the same distance apart, so using Red and Orange gems would work equally well in a situation where you'd need the Orange and Yellow gems.",
                "If you haven't already noticed, the notes the gems emit are not evenly spaced; for example, the Yellow and Green gems are slightly closer to each other than the Red and Orange gems or Orange and Yellow gems are. You'll need to pay close attention to make sure you match the transmission correctly."
