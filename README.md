# General description of stuff

The game.py has the main method that starts the game. General stuff like the Scene and SceneManager classes and the Gem class are in utils.py, and stuff specifically for the interval game is in interval.py.

# Aron: what you should do

For testing, you should change the type of scene that gets sent in game.py/main when you initiate the SceneManager. You can put your code in a platformer.py file which resembles the interval.py file in format.

# How to install and run

install python3
run `pip3 install pygame`
run `python3 game.py`
